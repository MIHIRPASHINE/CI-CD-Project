EXPLANATION OF THE JENKINS FILE USED IN CI/CD PROJECT:

This Jenkins Pipeline script defines a CI/CD process for a Java application using Maven, packaged in a Docker container, and includes steps for static code analysis with SonarQube. Let's break it down by sections:

 Pipeline Environment
- Agent Specification: The pipeline specifies a Docker agent to run the pipeline jobs. It uses a custom Docker image `abhishekf5/maven-abhishek-docker-agent:v1`, which presumably contains Maven and other required tools for building the Java application. The Docker socket is mounted to allow Docker commands to be executed within the agent container, enabling Docker-in-Docker operations.

 Stages
1. Checkout: This stage is intended to checkout the source code from a Git repository. Currently, it only echoes "passed" for simplicity, but the commented-out part suggests checking out the 'main' branch from a specific GitHub repository.

2. Build and Test: Executes commands to list directory contents for debugging (`ls -ltr`), then navigates to the project directory and runs a Maven command to clean any previous builds and package the application (`mvn clean package`). This generates the application's JAR file.

3. Static Code Analysis: Sets up an environment variable for the SonarQube URL and uses Maven to run static code analysis, sending the results to a SonarQube server. Authentication is handled through a `SONAR_AUTH_TOKEN` retrieved from Jenkins credentials.

4. Build and Push Docker Image: Builds a Docker image for the application using the Dockerfile located in the project directory. It tags the image with the build number and pushes it to a Docker registry. The registry credentials (`docker-cred`) are used for authentication. The actual Dockerfile location is commented out but implied to be within the project directory.

5. Update Deployment File: This stage is designed to update the Kubernetes deployment manifest with the new Docker image version tagged with the current build number. It uses `sed` to replace a placeholder in the deployment file with the build number. The script configures Git with user details, commits the changed deployment file, and pushes it to the specified Git repository using a GitHub token for authentication.

 
Summary:

This pipeline automates the entire process from code checkout to deploying the updated Docker image in a Kubernetes environment. It ensures that every commit can be built, tested, analyzed for code quality, packaged into a Docker container, and then deployed, following best practices in CI/CD. Static code analysis and containerization are crucial steps for maintaining code quality and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
