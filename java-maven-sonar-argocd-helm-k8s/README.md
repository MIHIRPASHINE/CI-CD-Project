# Jenkins Pipeline for Java based application using Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm and Kubernetes

Here is the break down of the CI/CD workflow displayed in the image. Let's go through each component step-by-step:

1. Source Code:
   - The process begins with the source code, which is stored in a version control system (e.g., Git).

2. Webhook:
   - A webhook is configured in the version control system to trigger the CI/CD pipeline whenever there is a change (e.g., a commit or pull request).

3. Jenkins:
   - Jenkins is used as the CI tool to manage the build pipeline.
   - The webhook triggers Jenkins to start the build process.

4. Maven:
   - Jenkins uses Maven to build the project. Maven handles the project dependencies, compiles the source code, and packages it into a deployable artifact (e.g., a JAR or WAR file).

5. SonarQube:
   - The built artifact is then analyzed by SonarQube for code quality and security issues.
   - If the code analysis passes (i.e., meets the quality gate), the pipeline continues. If not, the process exits, and a report is generated.

6. Tests:
   - The next step involves running automated tests. These could be unit tests, integration tests, or other types of tests to ensure the functionality of the code.
   - If the tests pass, the pipeline continues. If not, the process exits, and a report is generated.

7. Docker Image:
   - If the tests pass, the artifact is used to build a new Docker image.
   - The new Docker image is pushed to DockerHub (or another container registry).

8. Image Updater:
   - An image updater component watches for new images in the Docker registry.
   - When a new image is detected, it updates the image reference in the Kubernetes manifests stored in the Manifests Repo.

9. Argo CD:
   - Argo CD, a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, watches the Manifests Repo.
   - When changes are detected in the manifests (updated image reference), Argo CD synchronizes these changes with the Kubernetes cluster, effectively deploying the new version of the application.

10. Reports:
    - If any step in the process fails (e.g., SonarQube analysis, tests), Jenkins generates a report and sends notifications via email or other communication tools (e.g., Slack).

### Summary

The workflow automates the entire process from code commit to deployment:
1. Commit: Developers commit code to the repository.
2. Build: Jenkins builds the code using Maven.
3. Quality Check: SonarQube performs code quality analysis.
4. Testing: Automated tests are executed.
5. Containerization: A Docker image is built and pushed to DockerHub.
6. Deployment: Argo CD updates the Kubernetes deployment with the new image, ensuring continuous delivery.

This CI/CD pipeline ensures that code changes are automatically tested, validated, and deployed to the production environment with minimal manual intervention, enhancing the overall development and deployment efficiency.
