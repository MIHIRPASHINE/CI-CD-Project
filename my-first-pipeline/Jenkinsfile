# pipeline : This keyword is used to define the beginning of the Pipeline script. Everything that defines what your pipeline will do is contained within this block.

# agent : The agent directive specifies where the entire Pipeline, or a specific stage, will execute in the Jenkins environment. In this pipeline, the Pipeline is configured to run in a Docker container.

# docker { image 'node:16-alpine' } : This specifies that the Pipeline should run on a Docker agent using the node:16-alpine image. 
  node:16-alpine is a lightweight version of the Node.js 16 Docker image based on Alpine Linux. 
  Using Docker agents allows you to run your build in a container environment that you can define through Docker images. 
  This ensures that you have all the dependencies you need for your build without having to install them directly on the build agent.  

# stages : This section is used to define a series of one or more stages that the Pipeline will execute. 
  A stage is a logical unit of work that represents a part of the build process. For example, you might have stages for building, testing, and deploying your application.    

# stage('Test') : Here, we define a single stage named Test. 
  This is a label that will appear in the Jenkins UI to represent this part of the Pipeline. Each stage should have a descriptive name to make the pipeline easier to understand and debug.

# steps : Within a stage, the steps block defines one or more steps that are to be executed in sequence. 
  Steps are the smallest unit of work and are commands or actions that do the actual work of the stage.

# sh 'node --version' : This step executes a shell command inside the Docker container specified by the agent. 
  In this case, it's running node --version, which will output the version of Node.js that is installed in the node:16-alpine Docker image. 
  This is a common way to verify that your environment is set up as expected before proceeding with more complex tasks like running tests or builds.

#In summary, this Jenkins Pipeline script is configured to run in a Docker container using the Node.js 16 Alpine image. 
It has a single stage named "Test" that executes a shell command to print the Node.js version. 
This could be a preliminary step in a larger pipeline that involves testing a Node.js application.
